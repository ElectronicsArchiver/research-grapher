# Research Grapherâ€ƒ![Badge Status]

*Graphs **References** & **Citations** between* ***Papers***

<br>

## Goal

A user-friendly GUI visualizing a node network <br>
of references and citations in a given paper.

Alleviating the need to manually check each <br>
reference and search for it's citation online.



This should drop the unnecessary visits to mulitple publications by half(hopefully) since the [API](https://api.semanticscholar.org/) being accessed here will give a arxiv link if availabe.
