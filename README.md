# Research Grapherâ€ƒ![Badge Status]

*Graphs **References** & **Citations** between* ***Papers***

<br>

The goal here is to provide references and citations in a given paper in a GUI friendly node network for easier access as compared to manually going through each reference and searching for it's citations online.

This should drop the unnecessary visits to mulitple publications by half(hopefully) since the [API](https://api.semanticscholar.org/) being accessed here will give a arxiv link if availabe.
